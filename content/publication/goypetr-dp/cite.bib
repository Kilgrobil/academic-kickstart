abstract = {Combining probabilistic choice and non-determinism is a long standing problem in denotational
semantics. From a category theory perspective, the problem stems from the absence
of a distributive law of the powerset monad over the distribution monad. In this paper
we prove the existence of a weak distributive law of the powerset monad over the finite
distribution monad. As a consequence, we retrieve the well-known convex powerset monad
as a weak lifting of the powerset monad to the category of convex algebras. We provide
applications to the study of trace semantics and behavioral equivalences of systems
with an interplay between probability and non-determinism.},
