 abstract = {Combining probabilistic choice and non-determinism is a
long standing problem in denotational semantics. From a
category theory perspective, the problem stems from the
absence of a distributive law of the powerset monad over
the distribution monad. In this paper we prove the existence
of a weak distributive law of the powerset monad over the
finite distribution monad. As a consequence, we retrieve the
well-known convex powerset monad as a weak lifting of
the powerset monad to the category of convex algebras. We
provide applications to the study of trace semantics and behavioral
equivalences of systems with an interplay between
probability and non-determinism.},
