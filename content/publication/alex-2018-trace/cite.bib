 abstract = {A coalgebraic definition of finite and infinite trace semantics for probabilistic transition systems has recently been given using a certain Kleisli category. In this paper this semantics is developed using a coalgebraic method which is an instance of general determinization. Once applied to discrete systems, this point of view allows the exploitation of the determinized structure by up-to techniques. Thereby it becomes possible to algorithmically check the equivalence of two finite probabilistic transition systems.},
