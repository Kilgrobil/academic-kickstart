 abstract = {The powerset monad on the category of sets does not distribute over itself. Nevertheless a weaker form of distributive law of the powerset monad over itself exists and it essentially stems from the canonical Egli-Milner extension of the powerset to the category of relations. On the other hand, any regular category yields a category of relations, and some regular categories also possess a powerset-like monad, as is the Vietoris monad on compact Hausdorff spaces. We derive the Egli-Milner extension in three different frameworks: sets, toposes, and compact Hausdorff spaces. We prove that it corresponds to a monotone weak distributive law in each case by showing that the multiplication extends to relations but the unit does not. We provide an application to coalgebraic determinization of alternating automata.},
