abstract="We show how finite and infinite trace semantics of generative probabilistic transition systems arises through a determinisation construction. This enables the use of bisimulations (up-to) to prove equivalence. In particular, it follows that trace equivalence for finite probabilistic transition systems is decidable. Further, the determinisation construction applies to both discrete and continuous probabilistic systems.",

abstract="In the context of mathematical morphology based on structuring elements to define erosion and dilation, this paper generalizes the notion of a structuring element to a new setting called structuring neighborhood systems. While a structuring element is often defined as a subset of the space, a structuring neighborhood is a subset of the subsets of the space. This yields an extended definition of erosion; dilation can be obtained as well by a duality principle. With respect to the classical framework, this extension is sound in many ways. It is also strictly more expressive, for any structuring element can be represented as a structuring neighborhood but the converse is not true. A direct application of this framework is to generalize modal morpho-logic to a topological setting.",

    abstract="A coalgebraic definition of finite and infinite trace semantics for probabilistic transition systems has recently been given using a certain Kleisli category. In this paper this semantics is developed using a coalgebraic method which is an instance of general determinization. Once applied to discrete systems, this point of view allows the exploitation of the determinized structure by up-to techniques. Thereby it becomes possible to algorithmically check the equivalence of two finite probabilistic transition systems."
